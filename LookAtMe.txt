1. Event handler for shutdown event in Handler.py
forget about it no need for now.As long as i close my network before shutting down i will not be caught in the
middle of a crucial execution point during the shutdown event.
2. Add comics module.choose site for comics.And use then new implemenation for comics.
Decide on a efficent platform for the whole project.(Maybe java)But finish first.
